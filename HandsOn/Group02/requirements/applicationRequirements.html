Our idea for the application of this data set is related to the COVID regulation that affects restaurants, bars and stablishments in the data set. 
We would like to have an updated app that informs the user of the restrictions of capacity (how many people can be on the inside and the outside of the bar), 
schedule, and which municipalities or districts are able to access said stablishment, depending on the location of it inside the Community of Madrid.
