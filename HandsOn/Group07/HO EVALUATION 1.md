    Analysis
        - Visualizing a table is not a proper application. Any spreadsheet software can do that.
        - It is not clear which benefits will be obtained from linking those data with other datasets.
    Ontology
        - The ontology does not follow the resource naming strategy defined in the analysis.
        - Use Protege to define the ontology. Now it has multiple errors that could have been avoided by doing so.
        - The ontology does not contain datatype properties.
        - The domain and range of properties is not defined.
        - There are undefined classes.
