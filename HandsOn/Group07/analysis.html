  <h3>License analysis</h3>
  <text>The publisher of the dataset is the Government of United Kingdom and the righstholder is the Ministry of Justice, which provides the datase under a  Open Government Licence v3.0 that allows the exploitation of the information commercially and non-commercially. The license of dataset is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the information provider has its principal place of business, in this case, United Kingdom. In case of including the information in you own product or application you must acknowledge the source of the information in your product or application by including or linking to any attribution statement specified by the Information Providers and, where possible, provide a link to the license. If the Information Provider does not provide a specific attribution statement, as is our case, we must use the following: <i>Contains public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.</i></text>
  
  <p>Since the dataset is published by the United Kingdom Government and it already provides a really flexible license, we are going to use the same license provided, since we are not planning on making big changes to the information itself, only to the structure of how it is represented.</p>
