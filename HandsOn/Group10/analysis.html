<h1>Resource naming strategy</h1>
<p>First we define the classes of Gastos and Ingresos which correspond to the two datasets selected. The column Centro is related to both classes with the property "descripcionCentro" <br>
The class Gastos has the following properties (the string after the $ is the name of the column): <br>
- creditoGastado ,$(OBL_RECONOC) <br>
- tieneCapitulo ,$(Capitulo) <br>
- creditoDispuesto ,$(C_DISPUESTO) <br>
- tienePrograma ,$(Programa) <br>  
- tieneCentro ,$(Centro) <br>
- tieneSeccion ,$(Seccion) <br>
- descripcionEconomico ,$(Descripcion Economico) <br>
<br>
The class Ingresos has the following properties (the string after the $ is the name of the column): <br>
- tieneCapitulo ,$(Capitulo) <br>
- tieneCentro ,$(Centro)] <br>
- recaudado ,$(RECAUDADO) <br>
- previsionIngresos ,$(PREV.DEFINITIV) <br>
- descripcionIngresos ,$(Descripcion Economico) <br>
<br>
The classes Capitulo, Seccion and Programa have a description property, eg "descripcionCapitulo" <br>
<br>
The domain created is: http://group10.com/  with a slash URI <br>
<br>
Given the example URI: http://group10.com/Gastos <br>
- http://        -> Is the hypertext transfer protocol <br>
- group10.com/   -> Is the domain using a slash URI <br>
- Gastos         -> Is an example of a Class <br>
<br>
Another example URI: http://group10.com/recaudado <br>
- http://        -> Is the hypertext transfer protocol <br>
- group10.com/   -> Is the domain using a slash URI <br>
- recaudado      -> Is an example of a Property <br>
