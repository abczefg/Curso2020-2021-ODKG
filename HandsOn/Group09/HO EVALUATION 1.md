    Analysis
        - Visualizing a table is not a proper application. Any spreadsheet software can do that.
        - The analysis.html document is not correctly formatted.
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the explicit definition of the resource naming strategy.
        - It is not clear which benefits will be obtained from linking those data with other datasets.
    Ontology
        - I don't think that an organizational unit is subclass of an organization. They are two different types of entities.
        - Fix incorrect namespace: http://contsem.unizar.es/def/sector-publico/pproc.html#.
    RDF generated
        - Solve the character encoding issues.
        - Data from different entities is mixed in URIs: http://www.example.com/group09/department/DISTRITO_DE_MORATALAZ/contracting_body/COORDINADOR%2FA_DISTRITO_DE_MORATALAZ
        - The economicConditions resources only relate to the price, is that class really needed?
        - Check the encoding of booleans.
