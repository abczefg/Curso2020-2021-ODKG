- Data analysis

Finally, the dataset referring to the minor contracts carried out in Madrid during the year 2020 has been chosen. 

The dataset is composed of 12 variables and 2654 records. 

Within the variables there is the recognition number field (string of characters and numbers) composed of the constant string 'M2020' followed by 5 numbers starting from 00001 to 02662. There is also the file number (string of characters and numbers).

On the other hand, there is a field that indicates the name of the contracting sections, the contracting body (whether it is the director, coordinator, manager, etc.), the object of the contract which is of a different nature, specified by the field for the type of contract of a categorical nature (services, works, supplies or others) and the NIF corresponding to the contractor company (both character strings). 

Finally, there is the amount associated with the contract in question (numerical, in euros from 0€ as a collaboration generally, to 48.349,82€), the date of approval of the contract (approved in 2019), the term (also numerical, ranging from 0 to 12) and ends with the date of communication of the registration (from 2 of January 2020 to the 30 of June of this same year).

- License analysis

As for the license, as detailed in the requirements of the dataset, its reuse is allowed for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, understanding reuse as the use of Madrid City Council's own documents for any activity that does not come from a public administration.


- Name strategy

In this case, we have followed the guidelines given in the slides seen in class.

The domain that Protégé returns by default has not been followed, but has been replaced by a generic one for our project: www.example.com/group09#
All the classes that we have chosen are reused classes from another existing ontology (pproc, org, schemas, gr), following the recommendations of good practices, so they use that path.
The property is not defined based on the class, but is another entity, so they are independent and also, there is not the same path for individuals as for classes.
